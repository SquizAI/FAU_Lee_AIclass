# Deployment Strategies (Continued)

## 3. CI/CD Pipeline

### GitHub Actions Configuration

The CI/CD pipeline is implemented using GitHub Actions to automate testing, building, and deployment:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci-cd.yml
name: CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '18'
          cache: 'npm'
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci
      - name: Run linting
        run: npm run lint
      - name: Run unit tests
        run: npm run test:unit
      - name: Run E2E tests
        run: npm run test:e2e
        
  build:
    needs: test
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: github.event_name == 'push' && github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '18'
          cache: 'npm'
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci
      - name: Build
        run: npm run build
      - name: Upload build artifacts
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
        with:
          name: build-artifacts
          path: dist/
          
  deploy-staging:
    needs: build
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Download build artifacts
        uses: actions/download-artifact@v3
        with:
          name: build-artifacts
          path: dist
      - name: Deploy to staging
        uses: some-deploy-action@v1  # Replace with actual deployment action
        with:
          environment: staging
          
  deploy-production:
    needs: deploy-staging
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    environment: production  # Requires approval
    steps:
      - name: Download build artifacts
        uses: actions/download-artifact@v3
        with:
          name: build-artifacts
          path: dist
      - name: Deploy to production
        uses: some-deploy-action@v1  # Replace with actual deployment action
        with:
          environment: production
```

## 4. Infrastructure Setup

### Cloud Provider Recommendations

The Patient Advocacy Platform can be deployed on various cloud providers, with AWS being the primary recommended option:

#### AWS Infrastructure
- **Static Content**: Amazon S3 + CloudFront
- **API Server**: ECS Fargate or Lambda (serverless)
- **Database**: RDS (PostgreSQL) and DynamoDB
- **Authentication**: Cognito
- **Media Storage**: S3 with presigned URLs
- **Caching**: ElastiCache (Redis)

#### Azure Alternative
- **Static Content**: Blob Storage + Azure CDN
- **API Server**: App Service or Azure Functions
- **Database**: Azure SQL and Cosmos DB
- **Authentication**: Azure AD B2C
- **Media Storage**: Blob Storage
- **Caching**: Azure Cache for Redis

### Containerization Strategy

For non-serverless deployments, the application uses Docker containers:

```dockerfile
# Dockerfile
FROM node:18-alpine as build

WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci
COPY . .
RUN npm run build

FROM nginx:alpine
COPY --from=build /app/dist /usr/share/nginx/html
COPY nginx.conf /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf
EXPOSE 80
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
```
